## [1.2.6] - 2025-06-19

### Added

- **3 new shared skills** — `agent-task-workflow`, `agent-communication`, `agent-session-workflow` loaded globally via opencode.json
- **Content restoration in it-leader.md** — Subagent Capabilities Reference, Delegation Examples, expanded Parallel Delegation (contract checklist, Postman Sync, sequential vs parallel), TUI Question Templates (single/multi-select), Session Workflow (version check, TODO protocol, start/end templates), Quality Standards
- **Dynamic version in CLI** — `bin/init.mjs` now reads version from `package.json` instead of hardcoded `"1.0.0"`

### Changed

- `it-leader.md`: 324 → **810 lines** (+486 lines restored from main branch)
- `opencode.json` instructions: 9 → **12** (3 new shared skills)
- `package.json` description: updated agent/skills/commands counts
- `bin/commands/doctor.mjs`: expected agent count 14 → **34**
- `bin/commands/init.mjs` summary: all counts updated (13→31 agents, 14→34 files, 60+→200+ skills, 35+→46 commands)

---

## [1.2.7] - 2025-06-19

### Fixed

- **CLI path resolution** — `bin/init.mjs` path to package.json fixed for npx execution
- **npm dist-tag** — published 1.2.7 to npm registry with correct `latest` tag

### Changed

- Version: 1.2.6 → **1.2.7**

---

## [1.2.8] - 2025-06-19

### Added

- **Safe bash command permissions** — 17 non-aggressive bash patterns (`ls`, `pwd`, `which`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `echo`, etc.) auto-allowed at both top-level and per-agent level, reducing permission prompts by ~90%
- **Read-only tool permissions** — `glob`, `grep`, `list` set to `"allow"` at top-level (no more prompts for file search)
- **`agentmemory_*` centralized** — moved from per-agent duplication (33 agents × 1 line) to top-level permission
- **`figma_*` centralized** — set to `"deny"` at top-level (Figma MCP disabled, no Figma clutter in unrelated agents)

### Changed

- **`external_directory`** — relaxed from `"ask"` to `"allow"` with deny rules for sensitive dirs (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.config`, `~/secrets`)
- **`skill` permission** — per-agent `{"*": "allow"}` → shorthand `"allow"` (cleaner config)
- **`opencode.example.json`** — same permission improvements applied to the example config

---

## [1.2.5] - 2025-06-18

### Added

- **Subagent capability references** — detailed stack, capabilities, and output format for all 20+ subagents in IT Leader
